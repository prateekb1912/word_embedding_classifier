# Training Word Embeddings with the Sarcasm dataset

In this repo, we will use the sarcasm news headlines dataset to build a model which will classify different words into embeddings which then can be used in different NLP problems.

The sarcasm dataset is available (here)[https://storage.googleapis.com/laurencemoroney-blog.appspot.com/sarcasm.json].
